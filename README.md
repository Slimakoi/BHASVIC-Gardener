> Introduction

Hello, I'm trying to make a calculator for working prices using kotlin in android studios.

I figured out how to make Adaptive Classes but I'm having some trouble getting the **updated** data from them.

The code is located here -> https://github.com/Slimakoi/BHASVIC-Gardener

> What I want help with

Essentially I just want the **text** from the `EditText`'s on the `Card`s when the button `buttonCalculate` (on `MainActivity.tk`) is pressed.

> Conclusion

Help would be much appreciated, thanks!
